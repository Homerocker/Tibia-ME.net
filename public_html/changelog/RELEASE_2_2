Tibia-ME.net 2.2 CHANGELOG

The main aim of this release was to rewrite website markup from HTML to XHTML MP.
I also thought it's the right time to implement templates system
that's why a lot of functions and pages have been rewritten.
This also means you will encounter lot of new bugs.

Some of technical changes:

* Document->assign() and Document->display() are shortcuts
for Document->template->assign() and Document->template->display()

* markup changed from HTML 4 to XHTML Mobile Profile 1.2

* Document->navi visibility set to public
and it can be used to add navigation links
before call of Document->navi()

* Photo album comments counters are not displayed if user has disallowed commenting

* Dicument->navi() will ignore empty arrays

* Default extension for JPEG files changed from .jpeg to .jpg
.jpeg will not be used anywhere

* Auth::get_u() can accept optional parameter which value will be returned instead of current user ID
in case no user ID was sent by client

* Auth::get_u() parses $_REQUEST instead of $_GET to provide $_POST support (wtf?)

* Screenshots::screenshot_exists() was returning false always
(this fix was applied in previous version as it is important)

* require_once() replaced with require() where possible

* $document->pages visibility set from public to private

* Smileys borders smoothed

* Highscores are cached to decrease server load

* highscores lastupdate.dat contains date in the same format as the database

* Document->pages() receives array with vars names and values
it can also parse a pair of params (name, value) in case there's just 1 variable
additionally, it does not parse 'page' but automatically adds it to urls

* ScoresDate() replaced with Scores::date(), which relies on lastupdate.dat

* deprecated function Pages() removed

* Auth::RequireLogin() can receive 1 parameter
if it is set to false, it will forbid access for authorized users
default is true - forbids access for guests

* get_world() will parse $_REQUEST['world']

* class Common removed

* ScreenshotExists() removed

* Scores::next_level() replaced NextLevel()

* Auth::check_world() checks world with empty()

* ICQ number validation improved at profile

* Auth::CheckNickname() will also check if nickname has correct length (2-10)

* after lot of headache and little bit investigation it was decided to control all comments with a separate class

* comments order changed: latest first

* User() replaced with User::get_link()

* due to specific password encode algorythm password was getting invalid after nickname change
password hash does not depend on nickname now but more complex encryption is used to keep security on the same level

* session.auto_start switched off, session_start() is called in config.php instead

* $output parameter added to Document->navi()
when set to false function won't output anything
default is 1

* Encyclopedia->setPosition() removed

* Guild field added to Profile

* Forum->forum_icon() and Forum->board_icon() fixed to ignore moved topics "shadows" and display correct read/unread icon

Lot of other changes are not listed here
