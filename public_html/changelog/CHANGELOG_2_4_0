../classes/TochkiSuParser.class.php
* parse Tochki.su/TibiaME Encyclopedia

../core.php
* added strtolower() exception for TochkiSuParser to class_loader()
* added set_maintenance() and get_maintenance_message()
* removed SkillExists() and ItemExists() - parts of old encyclopedia
* added mysql_prepare_value() to format variables to be used in mysql query

../classes/gamecontent.class.php
../templates/game_content_weapons.tpl.php
../templates/game_content_armours.tpl.php
./gamecontent/
../templates/index.tpl.php
./index.php
../templates/game_content_monsters.tpl.php
* replaced old encyclopedia

../classes/TibiaMEComParser.class.php
* added fetch_news() (for future updates)

./update_2_4.sql
* updated `maintenance` to work with set_maintenance() and get_maintenance_message()
* old encyclopedia tables removed
* `notifications_old` (notifications backup) removed
* added `vk` field to `user_profile`
* [fix] removed unsigned attribute from scores_worlds.gain to store negative exp
(worlds with negative exp gain didn't appear on stats)
* [fix] manually added w31 to highscores stats
(it was missing due to new worlds handling bug in old updater.php, which is fixed in new highscoresupdater class as mentioned below)
* create new encyclopedia tables and import data previously fetched from tochki.su

./scores/updater.php
./cp/maintenance.php
* implemented set_maintenance()

../classes/document.class.php
../templates/page_header.tpl.php
* implemented get_maintenance_message()

../config.php
* set user agent for our bot
* [fix] update guests activity each time they load a page rather than on first visit only
(fixed guests online counter - it counted new guests only instead of all guests active over past 5 minutes,
however due to cookies mechanics counter will not update on first visit now (if cookies not set or expired) - in this case counter will update on next page load)
* [fix] do not update guest activity if browser didn't accept cookies
(fixed guests online counter - users without cookies won't be counted but at least they won't increase counter to incredible value, another downside is mentioned above)

P.S. although there still are technical conflicts between our guests counter and cookies the new counter is much more fair

../classes/highscoresupdater.class.php
./scores/updater.php
* parser rewritten with DOM and various performance optimizations
* clean achievements, characters-guilds dependencies and pvp rankings even if update fails
* [fix] more reliable detection of new game worlds
* [fix] generate all new game worlds stats correctly if more than 1 game world added
(only last game world would be generated before (ex.: missing w31))
* implemented set_maintenance()

../classes/templates.class.php
