+ many other fixes

This changelog may be incomplete, it may change later, also few minor features listed here may be not released yet.

../classes/cache.class.php
* replaced hardcoded extensions with Cache::get_extension()
(fixed issue with Cache::write() and Cache::read() referring to different files thus cache not working)
* added Cache::touch()
* .dat files contents are always serialized

../classes/browscap.class.php
* [fix] Browscap::get_version() will read version from browscap.ini
and "touch" cache file if it's outdated or does not exist
(don't re-download ini file when not necessary)

../classes/TibiameComParser.class.php
* TibiameComParser::get_client_url() returns null on error

../classes/geo.class.php
./cp/index.php
../templates/cp_index.tpl.php
./CHANGELOG/COPYRIGHT

../classes/auth.class.php
* removed old compatibility hashing method from Auth::login()

/DB
../classes/uploader.class.php
./screenshots/index.php
* Uploader::validate() will return hash and extension rather than filenames
* Uploader::validate() will use SHA3-256 rather than MD5 for files hashing (reduced collision chance)

../classes/images.class.php
* CLI mogrify replaced with php_imagick

./CHANGELOG/README

../classes/gamecodes.class.php
./index.php
* display available discounts if there IS enough platinum in stock but requested amount is not available as a SINGLE gamecode

./platinum.php
* fixed incorrectly displayed payment confirmation page when user proceeds to payment with no product selected

../config.php
* max viewport width increased to 360px (to look good on admin's new 5.5 inch device lol)

../templates/page_header.tpl.php

(fixed ads not hiding correctly when browser window resized)

../classes/uploader.class.php
../classes/images.class.php

./screenshots/index.php
../classes/screenshots.class.php
../templates/screenshots_index.tpl.php
../classes/themes.class.php
../templates/artworks_index.tpl.php
* implemented uploaded images compression (Images::compress()):
1) animated GIF are ignored
2) non-transparent PNG, BMP, GIF are converted to JPEG when using lossy compression
3) imagick JPEG quality set to 92% for lossy compression
4) lossless compression used for artworks section
5) GIF, BMP are converted to PNG (lossless)
6) if "compressed" image turns out to be larger than original image, original one is used
over 23% average filesize reduction without much visual quality loss (I hope)

../classes/filesystem.class.php
* added Filesystem::get_doc_root_path()

../classes/images.class.php
* Images::thumbnail() rewritten with Imagick

../classes/TibiameComParser.class.php
* TibiameComParser::get_clients_versions() will not fetch clients urls if actual client version and cached one match
(greately reduced amount of requests to tibiame.com (14->1) and download section load time)

../classes/ExchangerRuParser.class.php
* ExchangerRuParser::get_rate() returns null on error

../classes/document.class.php
../templates/page_header.tpl.php
