* added setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, null) to User::set_locale()
to set all decimal separators to "." and avoid lot of headache with Russian float numbers

This behavior may change in future, thus it is now recommended to cast all numeric values to int/float and call DB::quote() before sending them to DB.
This way it will be easy to do required formatting in DB::quote().
