This update completely replaces outdated "PHPExcelReader" with "PHPExcel".
Previously we converted .xlsx files to .xls to read them with PHPExcelReader but used PHPExcel to read images,
which made no sense and had bad impact on performance. 

../config.php
../core.php
* load_class() renamed to __autoload()

../core.php
* added code for PHPExcel specific paths to __autoload()

../PHPExcel/PHPExcel/Autoloader.php
* PHPExcel_Autoloader::register() disabled, relying on our __autoload()

../classes/gamecontent.class.php
* code rewritten for PHPExcel (added support for MS Office 2007 and newer formats, improved performance in some cases)
* removed GameContent::getColNameByNumber()
* added GameContent::colspan() and GameContent::rowspan() (wrong class though)

../classes/spreadsheet_excel_reader.class.php
* removed PHPExcelReader

../gamecontent_xls/community_allmonsters_SU2015.xls
* correctly bound all icons to appropriate cells

../PHPExcel/PHPExcel/Cell.php
* decrease PHPExcel_Cell::columnIndexFromString() returned value by 1 since columns indexes in PHPExcel start with 0 (bug?)
