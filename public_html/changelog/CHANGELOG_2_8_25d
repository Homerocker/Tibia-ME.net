* [fix] curl_get_contents(): CURL for some reason does not return correct http response code when making HEAD request
(fixed VK account not being linked correctly)
* curl_get_contents() will make request without GET params when checking URL availability
(fixed VK oauth where access code only works for a single request, thus availability check was breaking actual request)

../classes/domdocumentx.class.php
* DOMDocumentX::loadHTMLFile() will use curl_get_contents() for remote files
