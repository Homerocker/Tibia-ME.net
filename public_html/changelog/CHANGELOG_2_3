This change log does not include file names as most of code has been redesigned and it is easier to update all files at once.
This version is a part of 2.2.04, which was never released. Version number changed due to new MySQL API.

* MySQL API changed from mysql to mysqli, code redesigned

* User::get_id() can toggle mysqli::real_escape_string() for nickname, enabled by default; Auth::get_user_id() is deprecated now

* Friendlist::get_status() crash fixed

* "My themes" link fixed (hotfixed in 2.2.03)

* Remove theme screenshot if theme upload fails (fixes "screenshot had been uploaded" error)

* get_redirect() introduced, all manual operations with $_REQUEST['redirect'] (previously $_GET['redirect']) are deprecated

* Friendlist::get_status() will not try to parse $friend_id if it contains illegal characters (will return false instead of crash with error)

* Auth::get_user_data() replaced with User::get_data(), illegal characters detection algorithm improved to avoid crashes

* Memberlist pages navigation links fixed for search results

* PvP rank fixed in characters info

* mysqli::close() and ob_end_flush() removed from Document::__destruct() as those functions are called automatically
