* do not attempt to redirect user to User Agreement when viewing banishment info,
this caused infinite redirection loop and users with expired banishment could not use their accounts.
To use such accounts again you have to click on banishment message to mark it as viewed.
This is a temporal hotfix. User toolbar, User Agreement and banishment systems interaction is to be redesigned.
